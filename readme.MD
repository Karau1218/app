<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Support Tickets API (MVC Starter Project)</h1>
<p> This project is a foundational Node.js and Express application built using an MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure. It is made for a multi-part assignment for building, testing and documenting a REST-style API. </p>
<P>This repository reflects <strong> Assignment #1: Project Setup & Data Integration </strong> </p>

<h2> Project Purpose</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world internal support tickets API. At this stage, the project establishes:</p> 
<ul>
<li> A clean project structure</li>
<li> A running Express server</li>
<li> Environment-based configuration</li>
<li> A health/status endpoint</li>
<li> A realistic dataset prepared for later use</li>
</ul>

<p>Future assignments will build on this same codebase. </p>
